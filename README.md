Back-end Java application to learn: Spring Boot | REST API | PostgreSQL | Postman | Swagger | WebService ViaCep (search address) | Hikari | Spring Security | Token JWT | Cross Origin

Showing some application features in the Readme

### Spring Security | Token JWT:

Taking the authentication token by Postman, simulating a user login:

Sending the Bearer Token obtained through Postman's Authorization tab:

Saving a user via the POST method to test whether Spring Security has released it:

### Using Hikari to improve application performance:

### Testing HTTP Methods:

The IndexController class has the @RequestMapping("/usuario") annotation, which would be the root for our RESTful methods;

`http://localhost:8080/cursospringrestaupi/usuario`

By adding '/' at the end and selecting the POST method in POSTMAN, you can access the REST service created to save users:

`http://localhost:8080/cursospringrestapi/usuario/`

So let's see if it works:

It works! :D

I just hid the zip code generated by a zip code generator as a precaution so that no one's address would appear.

We can see that the password has been saved in the PostgreSQL database already encrypted.
